Next step:
We need to implement minimax as a strategy alternative to the "basic" computer
Initialise game controller with board checker instaed of adding it

Nice to have:
Add helper function to acceptance tests
Update board presentation, to improve user experience 
Refactor code


Completed
Need to check for a winning move
Add user instructions
Need to check for a game that is a draw
Player move in tic tac toe is still slimed
We need to add checks that player input is a valid grid reference
We need to add checks that the player move is to a blank reference (i.e.no previous goes there)

Assumptions
-Human player always goes first
-The computer is non-optimal (for now); it will move in the next available space

A nice python mimimax example
